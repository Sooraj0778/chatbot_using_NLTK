# chatbot_using_NLTK

This project involves creating a chatbot using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The chatbot processes and responds to user inputs based on textual data, leveraging techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization to generate meaningful responses.

# Features
# Text Processing:
Tokenization: Splitting the text into sentences and words.
Lowercasing: Converting all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer.

# Greeting Mechanism:
The chatbot can recognize and respond to greetings from the user.
Predefined greeting inputs and responses are used to initiate friendly interaction.

# TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert text into numerical representation.
Cosine similarity is employed to measure the similarity between user input and existing text data, helping the bot find the most relevant response.

# Response Generation:
Based on the similarity score, the chatbot generates a response.
If no relevant match is found, the chatbot informs the user of its inability to understand.

# User Interaction:
The chatbot engages in a loop, continuously interacting with the user until the user types "bye".
It handles thank you messages gracefully and ends the conversation when the user is done.

# Code Structure
# Imports:
Necessary libraries such as NumPy, NLTK, string, and random are imported for various functionalities.

# Data Preparation:
The text data is read from a file and converted to lowercase

# Tokenization:
Sentence and word tokenization using NLTK's sent_tokenize and word_tokenize

# Lemmatization:
Functions for lemmatizing tokens and normalizing text by removing punctuation.

# Greeting Functionality:
Predefined greetings and responses, along with a function to handle greetings.

# TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:
Using TfidfVectorizer to vectorize the text and cosine_similarity to find the best match for the user input.

# Chatbot Interaction Loop:
Main loop for user interaction, handling greetings, responses, and exit conditions

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective chatbot using NLTK in Python. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, the chatbot can process user inputs and generate appropriate responses, simulating a meaningful conversation
